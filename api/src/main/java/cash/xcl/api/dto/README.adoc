This package contains the DTO (Data Transfer Objects) for messages between clients and server as well as inter server communications.

== Commands and Events

Commands are messages with an instruction to do something. It is usually intended to be processed once by one systems.  
It can be rejected is it fails validation or is not approriate.

Events are messages about something which has happened.  There might be zero, one or manay systems which process this message.  
It can't be rejected as it has already happened. It could trigger a command to attempt to reverse the action at best.
